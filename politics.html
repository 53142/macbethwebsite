            <p>King James I was the ruler of Scotland, however, being the closest relative of Elizabeth I, he gained control of England and Scotland. There were many different concerns, the most significant being the ascension of the English throne and the supremacy of the monarchy. However, many people were against the idea of this king inheriting the throne because he was the closest relative of Elizabeth I, and so many people had planned and heavily plotted towards the assassination of the king. While the people were in a state of revolt, the idea of real witches had piqued the mind of the monarch since he implied because of the battering storms that were caused against the ships he traveled in to meet his newly married wife Anne of Denmark, he realized that witches are not trustworthy and could be extremely dangerous, therefore leading to the persecution of many witches.</p>
