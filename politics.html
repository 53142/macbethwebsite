                <h2>Political & Historical Context</h2>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth I of England died without an heir, leading to her closest relative: her cousin, King James VI of Scotland, inheriting the English throne as King James I of England. This united the crowns of England and Scotland under one monarch. However, his succession raised concerns about the legitimacy of James I as the English King. Tensions surrounding his rule were further heightened by several assassination attempts against him during this period.</p>

                <h2>Cultural & Societal Beliefs</h2>
                <p>King James I strongly believed in witchcraft, causing him to persecute many women as witches. Under his rule in Scotland, the <em>North Berwick witch trials</em> took place which accused and executed many people (mostly women) of witchcraft. King James I also supported the <em>Witchcraft Act of 1604</em> which made witchcraft punishable by death in England.</p>

                <p>Macbeth implements the ideas of the divine right of kings from this period of time, demonstrating how illegitimate rulers can lead to disastrous consequences </p>
