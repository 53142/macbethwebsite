                <h2>Political & Historical Context</h2>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth I of England died without an heir, so her cousin, King James I, inherited the English throne. King James I ruled both England and Scotland because of this. During this period, there were concerns about legitimacy surrounding the succession of the English crown. Likely partially fueled by this, there were multiple assassination attempts against King James I as well.</p>
