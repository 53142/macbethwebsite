            <h1>Purpose</h1>
                <h2>King James I</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons Shakespeare wrote Macbeth is as a tribute to King James I of England. Macbeth contains numerous references to him including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Macbeth being set in Scotland<br><em>(King James I was from Scotland)</em></li>
                    <li>Supernatural elements<br><em>(things the king was fond of)</em></li>
                    <li>Witchcraft which is depicted as evil<br><em>(the king executed many women as witches)</em></li>
                    <li>The King's fears like assassination which are then justified</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Shakespeare Needed?</h3>
                <p>Shakespeare wanted to keep the patronage from King James I of England for his acting company the King's Men. By keeping the King's favor through references in plays like Macbeth, Shakespeare hoped the King would continue to fund his acting company.</p>

                <h3>Superstitions</h3>
                <p>Macbeth is said to be cursed because many dangerous and even deadly events have happened during the production of the play over the years. This is because Shakespeare is said to have used the spells of real witches in his text, angering the witches, prompting them to curse the play. Events like mysterious deaths, riots, falling stage props, and the accidental use of real knives are attributed to this "curse". The oldest rumor of these occurrences was at the first showing for the king where the young actor playing Lady Macbeth mysteriously died mid-way through the play and their role had to be played by Shakespeare himself. As a result of this superstition, many people believe it is bad luck to refer to <em>Macbeth</em> by name in a theater so they simply refer to it as <em>The Scottish Play</em>.</p>

                    <h3>Globe Theater</h3>
                    <p>The first public production of the play was believed to be in 1611 at Shakespeare's Globe Theater. The Globe Theater was a large theater that housed Shakespeare's plays since 1599. The theater has remained a successful business from its creation to the present day.</p>
