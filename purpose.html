            <h1>Purpose</h1>
                <h2>King James I</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons Shakespeare wrote Macbeth is as a tribute to King James I of England. Macbeth contains numerous references to him including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Macbeth being set in Scotland<br><em>(King James I was from Scotland)</em></li>
                    <li>Supernatural elements<br><em>(Things the king was fond of)</em></li>
                    <li>Witchcraft which is depicted as evil<br><em>(The king executed many women as witches)</em></li>
                    <li>Assassination which is punished<br><em>(Assassination was one of King James I's fears)</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, Shakespeare renamed his acting company from the <em>Lord Chamberlain's Men</em> to the <em>King's Men</em>.</p>

                <h3>What Shakespeare Needed?</h3>
                <p>Shakespeare wanted to keep the patronage from King James I of England for his acting company the King's Men. By keeping the King's favor through references in plays like Macbeth, Shakespeare hoped the King would continue to fund his acting company.</p>
