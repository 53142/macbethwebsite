            <h2>Prior Works</h2>
            <p>In Macbeth, Shakespeare took inspiration from existing historical sources and literary works. Among the most notable influences on Macbeth was the <em>Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</em> by Raphael Holinshed. This work described the reigns of various monarchs in British history. Shakespeare based the Macbeth character off the Macbeth mentioned in Holinshed's work. The Macbeth mentioned in <em>Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</em> by Raphael Holinshed was a Scottish Nobleman who became the King of Scotland after defeating King Duncan in battle and was portrayed as a capable and respected ruler. In contrast, the Macbeth used by Shakespeare was drastically altered and was driven by ambition and influenced by supernatural forces like witches.</p>

            <h2>King James I</h2>
            <p>King James I, a major monarch during Shakespeare's time, was a significant influence on Macbeth. Since, James I was a big supporter of Shakespeare's acting company, James' interests and beliefs had large impacts on the play. James I's fascination with witchcraft and the supernatural, as shown in his book <em>Deamonologie</em>, which encouraged the practice of witch hunting, is demonstrated through the depiction of magic and witches in Macbeth.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Macbeth was likely created to appeal to James I's lineage. <em>Banquo</em>, who is portrayed in Macbeth as noble and virtuous, was believed to be an ancestor of the <em>Stuart</em> line which King James belonged to. By depicting Banquo favorably, Shakespeare flattered the king and reinforced the legitimacy of James I as the ruler of England and Scotland.</p>
