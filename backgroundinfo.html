            <h2>Background Information</h2>
            <h3>First Performance</h3>
            <p>The play was first performed in 1606, as a private performance for King James, at Hampton Court. This is surprising because it was played for the king as the main character of the play kills the king.</p>
            <h3>Play Breakdown</h3>
            <p>The play is about a man who saves the king's crown from a battle but is then told by three witches that he will eventually become king. Soon after he returned the crown to the king, he killed the king and became king himself. However, after his success, he becomes power hungry and gets himself killed by the previous king's son.</p>
            <h3>Superstitions</h3>
            <p>The play is said to be cursed because many dangerous and even deadly events have happened during the production of the play over the years. These events include mysterious deaths, riots, falling stage props, and the accidental use of real knives. The oldest rumor of these occurrences was at the first showing for the king where the young actor playing Lady Macbeth mysteriously died mid-way through the play and apparently their role had to be played by Shakespeare himself. A main superstition is that the play was cursed by real witches that were angry that he used real incantations in the play.</p>
