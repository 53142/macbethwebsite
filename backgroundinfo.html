                <h2>First Performance</h2>
                <p>The first public performance of Macbeth was at the outdoor Globe Theatre in April 1611 dated by an eyewitness account of Dr. Simon Forman. However, Macbeth was likely first performed prior to this account in 1606, as a private performance for King James, at Hampton Court.</p>

                <h3>The Play</h3>
                <p>Macbeth is about a man who saves the king's crown from a battle but is then told by three witches that he will eventually become king. Soon after he returned the crown to the king, he killed the king and became king himself. However, after his success, he becomes power hungry and gets himself killed by the previous king's son.</p>

                <h3>Superstitions</h3>
                <p>Macbeth is said to be cursed because many dangerous and even deadly events have happened during the production of the play over the years. This is because Shakespeare is said to have used the spells of real witches in his text, angering the witches, prompting them to curse the play. Events like mysterious deaths, riots, falling stage props, and the accidental use of real knives are attributed to this "curse". The oldest rumor of these occurrences was at the first showing for the king where the young actor playing Lady Macbeth mysteriously died mid-way through the play and their role had to be played by Shakespeare himself. As a result of this superstition, many people believe it is bad luck to refer to <em>Macbeth</em> by name in a theater so they simply refer to it as <em>The Scottish Play</em>.</p>
